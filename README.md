# Pose Estimation with Mediapipe and OpenCV

This tutorial demonstrates how to use **Mediapipe** and **OpenCV** for pose estimation in video files. It utilizes the Mediapipe Pose module to detect and draw human landmarks on frames captured from a video. Key steps include setting up video capture, resizing frames, processing poses, and rendering landmarks on two displays: one for the original frame with landmarks and another on a blank image. The code is ideal for building real-time applications in sports or fitness tracking, enabling users to analyze and visualize body poses effectively.
